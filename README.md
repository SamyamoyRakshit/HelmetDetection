# HelmetDetection

## Description
Here I've done helmet detection using Tenserflow Object Detection Version 1 with the help of ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco object detection model. We can run it in our local machine and through flask api we can also see the json version of the image. In this case we first need to encode image throuhg a site(eg. Base64.gru) and got details about the image in json.
It also detected helmets with 90% accuracy.
